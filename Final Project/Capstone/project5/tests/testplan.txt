When using Selenium for automated testing, it's important to cover a variety of scenarios to ensure that your web application functions correctly across different use cases. Here are some basic scenarios you can test with Selenium to achieve basic coverage:

1. **Navigation Tests**:
   - Verify that all navigation links (e.g., navbar links, buttons) redirect to the correct pages.
   - Test both internal and external links.

2. **Form Submission Tests**:
   - Ensure that forms can be filled out and submitted successfully.
   - Test form validation (e.g., required fields, email format, character limits).
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.

3. **User Authentication Tests**:
   - Test user registration: Fill out the registration form, submit it, and verify that the user is redirected to the correct page.
   - Test user login: Log in with valid credentials and verify that the user is redirected to the correct page.
   - Test authentication errors: Attempt to log in with invalid credentials and verify that the appropriate error message is displayed.

4. **Dynamic Content Tests**:
   - Verify that dynamic content (e.g., pop-ups, modals) is displayed correctly and interacts as expected.
   - Test AJAX requests: Trigger AJAX actions (e.g., loading more content, submitting data) and verify that the expected changes occur on the page.

5. **Element Visibility Tests**:
   - Ensure that elements are displayed or hidden correctly based on user interactions (e.g., toggling visibility, mouse hover).
   - Test responsive design: Resize the browser window and verify that elements adjust their layout accordingly.

6. **Data Display Tests**:
   - Verify that data is displayed correctly in tables, lists, or other UI components.
   - Test sorting and filtering functionality if applicable.

7. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Test error pages: Access invalid URLs and verify that the appropriate error page (e.g., 404 Not Found) is displayed.
   - Verify that error messages are displayed and informative when encountering server errors or other issues.

8. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Test accessibility features: Verify that elements have appropriate ARIA attributes, labels, and roles for screen readers.
   - Test keyboard navigation: Ensure that users can navigate through the site using only the keyboard.

9. **Cross-browser and Cross-platform Tests**:
   - Test your application on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility.
   - Verify that the application behaves consistently across different environments.

By covering these basic scenarios, you can ensure that your web application functions correctly under normal usage conditions and provides a good user experience. As your application evolves, you can expand your test suite to cover more complex scenarios and edge cases.
